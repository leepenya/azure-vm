<h1>Creating a Virtual Machine in the Cloud</h1>
Summary: In this project, I created a virtual machine on Microsoft's cloud platform and observed the network topology generated by Azure.<br />

<h2>Requirements</h2>

- Computer with internet connection
- Microsoft Azure account
  - Credit card to set up the account

<h2>High-Level Steps</h2>

- Step 1: Create a virtual machine ("VM").
- Step 2: Verify validation and successful deployment of the VM.
- Step 3: Observe the VM's network topology.

<h2>Specific Steps</h2>

<p>
1. I filled out the above form. First, I created a resource group (like a folder for organizing and managing resources, such as VMs) and named my VM. Then I selected a region, image (base operating system), and size for the VM.

2. Further down the form, I entered credentials for my administrator account and confirmed I had an eligible license.

3. Azure showed my VM had passed the validation check. I noted the VM's cost per hour and then clicked on "Create."

4. My VM was successfully deployed! I then clicked on "Go to resource."

<p>
5. The resource page (titled "vm1" after my VM) provided key information about my VM, including its location, operating system, size, and public IP address.

<p>
6. The Network Watcher | Topology page indicated Azure had set up a virtual network (vm1-vnet), subnet (default), network interface card (vm1278), network security group (similar to a firewall), and IP address (vm1-ip) for my VM. </p>
